//closure in js is a function that has to access to variable in its outer/parents function
// even parent's function has returned (inner function has retained value of parent function and variable )
//closure are created when function is defined inside another function , inner function retain /access to variable in the outer scope
//in other language when you once returned function so value will not retained but due to closure in javascript once you called fun even value is retained 


// function sum(a){
// console.log(a,'a')
// var b = 3  //lexical variable 
//     return function(c){ //// which sum fuc has returned that we wcan get in annonyomous func // we will not lost a and c value still retained when fun will call again
// return a+b+c
//     }

// }
// const store = sum(2)  // which sum fuc has returned that we wcan get in annonyomous func
// console.log(store(4),'store')

    // In JavaScript, closures allow a function to "remember" and access variables from its outer (enclosing) scope,

// lexical environment 
//lexical enviroment in js is structure that holds variable and function reffrence (access variable from outer function) in a specific scope .
// Each function and block of code create its own  lexical environment .
//it contain local variable and reffrence to outer lexical environment .
// Inner function can inherits/access the variable from outer scope .



// function outer() {
//   let a = 10; // Stored in outer()'s Lexical Environment

//   function inner() {
//     let b = 20; // Stored in inner()'s Lexical Environment
//     console.log(a + b); // Can access 'a' from outer()
//   }

//   inner(); // Calling inner()
// }

// outer();
// üîç What Happens in the Lexical Environment?
// 1Ô∏è‚É£ outer() is called

// A Lexical Environment is created.
// It stores { a: 10, inner: function reference }.
// 2Ô∏è‚É£ inner() is called inside outer()

// A new Lexical Environment is created for inner().
// It stores { b: 20 }.
// It also has a reference to outer()'s Lexical Environment (so it can access a).
// 3Ô∏è‚É£ Scope Chain:

// inner() does not have a inside its own Lexical Environment, so it looks up to outer()'s environment to find a = 10.
// Then, it prints 10 + 20 = 30.



//Each function and block of code has its own lexical environment .
//it contains local variable and reffrence to outer lexical environment (known as scope chain )
// inner function can  inherits/access the variable from the outer  scope  due to scope chain..
// it also keep the reffrence to the outer scope .
//every function store variable and function reffrence in its own lexical environment 
//lexical environment helps js remember where function and variable exits in memory .
